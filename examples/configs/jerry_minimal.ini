# `fuzzinator jerry_minimal.ini`

# Sections starting with 'sut.' prefix define how target applications (a.k.a.,
# system-under-test or SUT) will be handled. The string after 'sut.' will be
# used as the identifier of the target. In this example, we deal with
# JerryScript.
[sut.jerry]
# StdinSubprocessCall will execute the target and return an issue dictionary if
# the target exits with a non-zero code.
call=fuzzinator.call.StdinSubprocessCall

# Define parameters expected by StdinSubprocessCall.
[sut.jerry.call]
# 'command' defines how SUT has to be executed.
command=./build/bin/jerry -
# Directory where 'command' has to be run.
cwd=</path/to/jerryscript/root/directory>

# Sections starting with 'fuzz.' prefix bind SUTs and test case generators.
[fuzz.jerry-with-random]
# Specify the SUT by referencing the appropriate config section.
sut=sut.jerry
# Specify the fuzzer by referring a Python callable.
